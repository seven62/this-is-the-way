## STONES 1

### task list

#### ROCK Overview
This is just the basic layout of ROCK and a brief overview of each of its components. The defenders are not expected to retain this information and won't be "tested" on any of its materials. They will however revisit this information more in depth in STONES 2 so it is important they are introduced to it
* E
* L
* K
* steno
* suricata
* fsf
* bro
* kafka

#### basic kibana
* navigation
* filtering
* lucene search
* utilize dashboards

### Bro logs
* log structure
* conn
* dns
* ssh
* http

#### basic networking
* terminology / vocab
* gen topology
* protocols (introduced in conjunction with bro logs)
* packets

#### Research 101
* How to follow a thread
  - Knowing when to ask questions
* Providing evidence of assertions

*Commentary:* _Too often we try to tell people to "find evil." This can be an extremely daunting task to an inexperienced defender. Instead we should focus more training on how to follow to ground abnormalities. These abnormalities can be given out by more senior members and allow the juniors to follow the thread and learn how or why something interacts the way it does, and understand why it is atypical to what one would expect to see._

#### Tools / Env
* atom
* mumble
* browser

#### Practical Exercise
Ideally this PE would emphasize the skills the new material the defenders have learned thus far. There should be three separate infection points that are relatively easy to find and investigate. They should have to use a variety of filters to find them and be alerted to the data using dashboards but not required for all to be used for each hunt. At least one of these should be a blind hunt meaning that they have no tip-off from the exercise trainer that this is a bad scenario while also another should be given as "Investigate this thread".

The instructor should be present to guide the defenders through the exercise and provide assistance when they are stuck as well as serve as shot validators for the defenders analytic assertions.
