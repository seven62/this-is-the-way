Resource for learning the art of cyber defenders and threat hunters.

The sections are merely guideposts to get this project off the ground.  If there is a better structure, throw an issue up and we can discuss.

Created using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material Theme](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).  

## How To Contribute

### 1.) Pull Requests  
Fork this repo, edit the markdown for the page(s) of your choosing, and send us a pull request.

### 2.) Issues
File an issue with your change or addition and someone will get it added.

### 3.) Anonymous Submission
If you have something you'd like added but don't want attributed to you, contact one of the maintainers and we'll slide it in without your name attached.

**NOTE:** New requests will be handled in that order.  Working PR's will always get posted long before manual changes.

## "Development"

To test this out locally and see your changes before you send off an ill-fated pull request and subject yourself to the scrutiny of your peers and the Internet at large, do the following:

First, make sure you have python installed.

Next, install the requirements via Pip: `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material pygments`

Clone the repo.

Make your changes.

Build the site (from the top level folder): `mkdocs build --clean`

Serve it up to check it out: `mkdocs serve`
